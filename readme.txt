== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the use of thsi plugin? =

To entertain your visitors :)
Especially, because this plugin has a "reward" page, you can hide a "treasure", for example, a coupon, a discount code, or your new song or illustration.

= What is a "reward" page? =

It is a page that only those who have completed the game can have an access to.
If you try to access it directly, a "Sorry" message will be shown.

= How many games can I put in my website? =

At the current version, you can only set one runner game on your website. I am working on to make it possible to set multiple games.

= Why is the stage 11 maximum? Can I make it longer? =

At the moment, you cannot. To be honest, 11 is almost impossible to complete.

= Can it be played on a smartphone? =

Yes!
